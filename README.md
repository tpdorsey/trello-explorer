# Using the Trello API

These files are some simple scripts I used to figure out and use the [Trello API](https://developers.trello.com/advanced-reference) with the [ruby-trello gem](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/ruby-trello).

The first thing you'll need to do is get your authentication keys. Details are here: [Start Building | Trello Developers](https://developers.trello.com/get-started/start-building)

trello-explorer.rb is meant to help find the IDs of your boards and lists. Maybe there's another way to navigate those in a more straightforward manner, but I couldn't figure it out.
